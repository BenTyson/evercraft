## üìã Documentation Maintenance

### After Each Session

Update `session-start/CURRENT_STATUS.md`:

- Document bugs fixed or features added
- Update "Next Steps" section

### After Major Features

Update `session-start/CODEBASE_MAP.md`:

## üéØ Context Budget Management

**Recommended session restart triggers:**

1. After 2-3 context compactions
2. After completing major phase milestones
3. When switching to completely different feature areas
4. When noticing increased errors or slower responses

This folder structure makes session restarts seamless - just read `/session-start/` and continue where you left off.
