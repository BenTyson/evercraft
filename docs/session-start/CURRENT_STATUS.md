## 🔧 Recent Technical Decisions

### Phase 6 Shipping Integration

1. **Shippo over EasyPost:** Cleaner API, better documentation
2. **Conditional initialization:** Graceful degradation if API key not configured
3. **Auto-status update:** Creating label automatically updates order to SHIPPED
4. **Bulk processing ready:** Server actions support bulk label generation

### Prisma Schema Convention

**CRITICAL DECISION:** Relation names MUST be lowercase/camelCase

- ✅ Correct: `shop`, `category`, `images`, `buyer`
- ❌ Incorrect: `Shop`, `Category`, `ProductImage`, `User`
- **NEVER run `npx prisma format`** - it auto-capitalizes
- **Always use `npx prisma validate`** to check syntax

## 🐛 Known Issues

**None currently.** All systems operational.
