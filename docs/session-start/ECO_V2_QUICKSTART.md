# Eco-Impact V2 - Quick Resume Guide

**Current Phase:** üéâ Phase 4 COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 5
**Last Updated:** October 11, 2025
**Status:** üü¢ Implementation Successful

---

## What We're Doing

Replacing the numerical eco-scoring system (0-100) with a **badge-based + completeness percentage** system.

**Why?**

- Old system: Arbitrary algorithmic scoring, tedious free-text forms
- New system: Clear badges, objective completeness %, tiered toggles

**Full Plan:** `/docs/planning/ECO_IMPACT_V2_MIGRATION.md`

---

## Current Status

### Phase Completion

- ‚úÖ **Phase 0: Planning & Design** - Complete (Oct 10, 2025)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Database Schema** - Complete (Oct 11, 2025)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2: UI Components** - Complete (Oct 11, 2025)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3: Server Actions** - Complete (Oct 11, 2025)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4: Page Updates** - Complete (Oct 11, 2025)
- ‚è≥ **Phase 5: Cleanup** - Pending (2-week monitoring period)

### Code Changes Summary

- ‚úÖ Database: 2 new tables (ShopEcoProfile, ProductEcoProfile)
- ‚úÖ Components: 6 new eco-components created
- ‚úÖ Actions: 3 new server action files

---

## Next 3 Steps (Phase 5 - After 2-Week Monitoring)

### 1. Monitor New System

**Duration:** 2 weeks from Oct 11, 2025
**Actions:**

- Watch for TypeScript errors
- Monitor seller feedback
- Check analytics for eco-filter usage
- Verify completeness calculations are accurate

### 2. Remove Deprecated Fields (After Monitoring)

**Files to update:**

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Remove `ecoScore`, `ecoAttributes` from Product
- Run migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name remove_deprecated_eco_fields`

### 3. Delete Legacy Components

**Files to remove:**

- `src/components/eco/sustainability-score.tsx`
- Any lingering references to `ecoScore`
- Update any remaining free-text eco-questions

---

- ‚úÖ `src/components/seller/product-eco-profile-form.tsx` - Product form integration

### New Server Actions (Phase 3)

- ‚úÖ `src/actions/shop-eco-profile.ts` - Shop CRUD + tier calculation
- ‚úÖ `src/actions/product-eco-profile.ts` - Product CRUD + completeness calculation
- ‚úÖ `src/actions/products.ts` - Updated with eco-filtering (13 filters)
- ‚úÖ `src/actions/seller-products.ts` - Updated for eco-profile handling

### Updated Pages (Phase 4)

- ‚úÖ `src/app/browse/page.tsx` - Added EcoFilterPanel
- ‚úÖ `src/app/products/[id]/page.tsx` - Added EcoDetailSection
- ‚úÖ `src/app/seller/products/product-form.tsx` - Integrated ProductEcoProfileForm
- ‚úÖ `src/app/seller/settings/settings-tabs.tsx` - Added Eco-Profile tab
- ‚úÖ `src/app/seller/settings/eco-profile-tab.tsx` - New tab component

### Legacy Components (To be deleted in Phase 5)

- ‚è≥ `src/components/eco/sustainability-score.tsx` - DEPRECATED (still present)

---

## What Was Completed (Oct 11, 2025)

### Phase 1: Database Schema ‚úÖ

- Added ShopEcoProfile model (10 tier-1 + 7 tier-2 fields)
- Added ProductEcoProfile model (17 tier-1 + 5 tier-2 fields)
- Enhanced Certification model (added `verified`, `verifiedBy`, `verifiedAt`)
- Ran migration successfully
- Populated 4 shops and 5 products with initial profiles

### Phase 2: UI Components ‚úÖ

- Created 6 new eco-components (completeness bar, badges, filters, forms, detail section)
- All use CVA for variant styling
- All integrate with Prisma data types
- Forms have live completeness calculation

### Phase 3: Server Actions ‚úÖ

- Created shop-eco-profile.ts (CRUD + tier logic: starter/verified/certified)
- Created product-eco-profile.ts (CRUD + completeness %)
- Updated products.ts with 13-filter eco-filtering system
- Updated seller-products.ts to handle eco-profiles in create/update

### Phase 4: Page Updates ‚úÖ

- Browse page: EcoFilterPanel integrated (desktop + mobile)
- Product detail page: EcoDetailSection replaces old sustainability section
- Product form: ProductEcoProfileForm with 17 toggles
- Seller settings: New "Eco-Profile" tab with ShopEcoProfileForm

## How to Continue

### Current State

All implementation is complete. System is running in **dual-mode**:

- New eco-profiles are being used
- Legacy fields (ecoScore, ecoAttributes) still present

### Next Steps

1. **Monitor for 2 weeks** (until Oct 25, 2025)
   - Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
   - Watch error logs
   - Gather seller feedback

2. **After monitoring**, proceed to Phase 5:
   - Remove deprecated fields from schema
   - Delete sustainability-score.tsx component
   - Final QA pass

## Common Commands

```bash
# Check database tables
psql evercraft -c "\dt"

# Run Prisma migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Check for TODOs
grep -r "TODO.*eco.*v2" src/

# View migration status
npx prisma migrate status

# Rollback last migration (if needed)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

## Key Decisions Made

### Badges over Numerical Score

**Why:** Numerical scoring was arbitrary and didn't respect that different buyers care about different eco-attributes.

### Completeness Percentage

**What:** 0-100% based on fields filled (objective, transparent)
**Why:** Rewards transparency, not subjective "goodness"

### Non-Breaking Migration

**What:** Keep old fields until Phase 5, add new tables alongside
**Why:** Lower risk, allows rollback, gives sellers time to adapt

## System Overview

**Badge-Based Filtering:**

- 13 eco-filters available on browse page
- Buyers can filter by: Organic, Recycled, Vegan, Biodegradable, Fair Trade, Plastic-Free, Recyclable, Compostable, Minimal, Carbon-Neutral, Local, Made-to-Order, Renewable Energy

**Completeness System:**

- Products: 17 tier-1 toggles (70%) + 5 tier-2 details (30%)
- Shops: 10 tier-1 toggles (70%) + 7 tier-2 details (30%)
- Tiers: Starter (<60%), Verified (60-84%), Certified (85%+)

**Non-Breaking Migration:**

- Old fields still present: `ecoScore`, `ecoAttributes`
- New fields coexist: `ecoProfile` relation
- Removal planned for Phase 5 (after monitoring)
