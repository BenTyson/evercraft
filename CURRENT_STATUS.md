## Key Decisions Made

1. **Certification Badges Over Progress Bars**: Replaced numerical sustainability scores with discrete certification badges on product cards for cleaner UX and better trust signals
2. **Badge Display**: Max 3 badges shown on product cards (text-only, minimal design)
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (local development)
4. **Color Palette**: Forest greens (#2D5016, #4A7C2C) and eco greens (#7FB069, #A8D5BA)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Continue with Phase 0 by building Browse page and Product Detail Page
2. **Short-term**: Begin Phase 1 (Authentication) after Phase 0 completion
3. **External**: Collaborate with designer on Figma mockups (parallel track)

---

## Notes

- Design system prioritizes sustainability messaging and trust signals
- Mobile-first responsive design across all components
- Accessibility and performance are ongoing priorities throughout development
